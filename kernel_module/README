This directory contains the source code for the kernel module. 
You may try to "make" with root permission (e.g. "sudo make"). 
If it success, you will see a "npheap.ko" under this directory. 
You can then type "make all" using root permission to install the 
kernel module and the header into system directories. After you are 
done with this, you can now "insmod npheap.ko" using root. If 
this success, you can navigate to /dev directory and you should 
see a "npheap" device under this directory! However, at this 
point, this device doesn't really do anything. It's now your 
responsibility to endow this device with some features! You may 
need to unload the device by using "rmmod npheap" before you want 
to apply any change to the kernel module.
